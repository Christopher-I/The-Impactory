# Impact Framework Analysis - YWCA Survey & Platform

## 🎯 CRITICAL INSIGHT: This Is Research Infrastructure, Not Just Data Storage

The "About the Impact Survey" document reveals that **10Seven is building a research platform**, not just a data warehouse. They have a sophisticated impact measurement framework with academic rigor.

---

## The Impact Measurement Framework

### 4 Impact Measurement Pillars

These are "the foundation of our (new) data architecture" - the categories that help measure impact:

1. **Influence**
   - Metrics showing YWCA's unique position as local + national presence
   - Uplifting voices of beneficiaries
   - Pushing for policies that improve lives

2. **Research**
   - Groundbreaking research and insights
   - Changing how society thinks about equity

3. **Local Relevance**
   - Meeting communities where they are
   - Giving LAs support, guidance, flexibility
   - Making difference on the ground
   - Responding to community needs in real time

4. **Collective Disruption**
   - Bringing together best insights from local entities at national level
   - Offering differentiated point of view on gender and racial equity

**Platform Implication:** The platform needs to tag/categorize data by these pillars to enable analysis.

### 3 Types of Impact (What They Want to Measure)

#### 1. Societal Impacts (Community/Cultural Level)
Shifts in social norms, behaviors, attitudes, or conditions that benefit community as a whole:

- Entities in local communities demonstrate **shift in communication** about a social problem
- Shift in communication leads to **reduction/elimination of social denial**
- Local government/administrative body **changes or adopts policy** reflecting YWCA goals
- **YWCA positioned as leader** in developing solutions

#### 2. Beneficiary Impacts (Individual Level)
Positive changes for individuals receiving services directly:

- Increased **access or ability to secure basic needs**
- Increased **confidence and/or skills**
- Increased **sense of belonging and/or safety**

#### 3. Institutional Impacts (Systems Level)
Changes in institutions that influence policies and practices:

- Institutions **exhibit more meaningful engagement** on social issues
- Institutions **recognize their role** in perpetrating harm
- Institutions **assume responsibility and take explicit steps** to undo harm

**Platform Implication:** Programs and organizational efforts need to be linked to these impact types for reporting and analysis.

## Violence Types Framework

### Racial Violence
**Definition:** The systematic mistreatment and degradation of specific groups of people, based on race; supported and enforced by society and its institutions.

**Examples of Interventions:**
- Undoing impacts of redlining
- Undoing systemic biases through narrative change
- Combating stereotypes, biases, racial power dynamics
- Training on narrative change
- Training groups targeted by racism to manage and overcome it
- Research on harms of racism
- Advancing environmental justice at intersection of racial justice
- Defending and protecting equal access to voting
- Providing basic needs for a specific racial group
- Voter registration and education

### Gender-Based Violence
**Definition:** The systematic mistreatment and degradation of specific groups of people, based on gender; supported and enforced by society and its institutions.

**Examples of Interventions:**
- Improving maternal health outcomes
- Access to affordable childcare
- Closing the gender pay or wealth gap
- Advocating for reproductive rights and freedoms
- Women's empowerment
- Intimate partner violence protection and prevention
- Advancing environmental justice at intersection of gender-based justice

### Economic Violence
**Definition:** A systemic attitude, pattern of thinking, practice, process, or policy directed by institutions toward people whose social status is devalued because characteristics intrinsic to their identities differ from what is valued by those in power. Often results in socioeconomic damaging of a community's wealth-building capability.

**Examples of Interventions:**
- Guaranteed income programs
- Access to financial institutions and services
- Workforce development and training
- Providing financial literacy/education
- Providing entrepreneurship education and training
- Providing leadership programming
- Securing access to housing
- Enhancing ability to build assets
- Providing basic needs for all (not just a specific group)
- Undoing how environmental injustices disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic strata

**Platform Implication:** Programs need structured tagging by violence type, and the platform should suggest/validate intervention types based on violence type selected.

## Key Definitions (Data Dictionary for Platform)

### Organizational Terms

**Full-time worker**: Someone who works at least 30 hours per week and will receive a W-2 or 1099. May include 1099 contractors.

**Part-time worker**: Someone who works less than 20 hours per week and will receive a W-2 or 1099.

**Volunteer**: Someone who serves the organization without compensation.

**Annual revenue**: IRS "gross receipts" on 990 - total amounts received from all sources during tax year, without subtracting costs/expenses.

**Social problem**: A social condition or set of conditions that is troublesome, prevalent, can be changed, and should be changed.

**Strategic plan**: Document outlining organization's goals, strategies, efforts, activities, and actions to achieve those goals.

### Program-Related Terms

**Organizational effort**: Initiatives or activities organization undertakes (e.g., advocacy work leading to policy change) NOT associated with a program.

**Program**: A set of planned activities or services that the organization provides to achieve its intended impact and advance its mission.

**Recent and/or active program**: Programs implemented from 2022 to present.

**Stated objective or purpose**: The specific goal or intended outcome that a program aims to achieve through stated activities.

**Program activity**: Specific actions, tasks, and/or steps taken to implement program's objectives, directly contributing to desired outcome (e.g., trainings, various forms of assistance).

### Impact-Related Terms

**Intended impact**: The tangible effect we hope to have or declare we will have on our beneficiaries, communities, and broader society as a result of our organizational efforts, programs, and core values.

**Societal impact**: Positive changes or outcomes at community/cultural level, involving shifts in social norms, behaviors, attitudes, or conditions that benefit community as whole, not just individual beneficiaries.

**Beneficiary impact**: Positive changes or outcomes experienced by individuals or groups who receive a program's services directly.

**Institutional impact**: Positive changes or outcomes in local institutions that influence their policies and practices.

**Evidence**: Information, data, or documentation that demonstrates the program has achieved intended outcomes or made significant progress toward goals.

### Support Infrastructure Terms

**Tools**: Something that enables you to effectively measure, manage, and execute programs and activities (e.g., research software, collaboration platforms, data analysis, volunteer management systems).

**Supports**: Assistance and resources that help enhance organization's capacity and effectiveness (e.g., legal and compliance support, changed or adopted policy).

**Systems**: An organized set of procedures and processes that help make decisions to achieve intended impact (e.g., pre/post-surveys, focus groups, community partnerships).

## Impact Areas (YWCA USA's 3 Categories)

Current way YWCA broadly categorizes programs:

1. **Women & Girls Empowerment**
2. **Racial Justice & Civil Rights**
3. **Health & Safety**

**Note from document:** "There may be an opportunity to add specificity as we learn more about LAs and their different programs and offerings."

**Platform Implication:** Impact areas should be flexible/expandable, not hardcoded.

---

## Correlation Analysis Plans

The document mentions "Summary of anticipated correlation tables" - they plan to analyze statistical associations between:

### Correlates (Variables to Test for Association):

**From "About Your Organization":**
- Geography
- Number of full-time and part-time workers
- Number of locations
- Revenue
- Major funding type
- Strategic plan (yes/no)
- Demographics of those served

**From "About Organizational Efforts":**
- Types of organizational efforts
- Intended impact
- Likelihood of impact
- Tools, supports, and/or systems

**From "About Your Programs":**
- Languages of programs delivered
- Impact areas
- Forms of violence addressed
- Intended impact
- Tools, supports, and/or systems

**From "Programs Addressing Violence Types":**
- Program activity type
- Societal impacts
- Beneficiary impacts
- Institutional impacts
- Forms of evidence

**From "Aspirations":**
- Aspirational program activity type
- Aspirational intended impact
- Aspirational program and organizational effort type

**Platform Implication:** The platform needs to support statistical analysis and correlation calculations across these variables. This is research infrastructure.

---

## The Survey Toolkit They Provide

When LAs receive the survey link, they also get:
1. **Impact Survey Glossary** (all the definitions above)
2. **FAQs**
3. **Survey link**

**Platform Implication:** The platform should include built-in help/tooltips with these definitions so users don't have to reference external documents.

---

## Integration with Trauma Graph

The document notes: "What counties, cities, zip codes, and/or neighborhoods do you serve? [will overlay on Traumagraph™]"

This confirms the geographic data will be used to overlay chapter service areas with 10Seven's trauma graph data.

**Platform Implication:** Geographic data must be structured for mapping/overlay functionality.

---

## The Real Goal: "Integrate a social analysis of power, oppression, and privilege to create impact (that we can measure)"

This line from the document reveals the deeper purpose:
- Not just tracking activities
- Not just counting beneficiaries
- **Measuring how programs shift power dynamics and undo systemic oppression**

This is why they have:
- Institutional impacts (getting powerful institutions to change)
- Societal impacts (shifting narratives and policies)
- Complex violence frameworks (understanding systemic nature of harm)

---

## What This Means for Platform Design

### 1. Structured Taxonomies
The platform needs controlled vocabularies/taxonomies for:
- Violence types (racial, gender-based, economic)
- Impact types (societal, beneficiary, institutional)
- Impact measurement pillars (influence, research, local relevance, collective disruption)
- Evidence types (policy adoption, pre/post surveys, media, funding, etc.)
- Program activity types (varies by violence type)

### 2. Research Capabilities
This isn't just data storage - it's research infrastructure:
- Statistical analysis (correlations, regressions)
- Cross-tabulations
- Filtering by multiple variables
- Export to research tools
- Possibly integration with statistical software (R, SPSS, Stata)

### 3. Data Validation
Inputs should be validated against the framework:
- If program addresses "racial violence," suggest appropriate intervention types
- If program claims "institutional impact," require appropriate evidence types
- Ensure coherence between violence type, activities, and impacts

### 4. Built-in Definitions
Every field should have tooltip/help text with official definitions from glossary

### 5. Flexible Framework
Note says impact areas "may need more specificity as we learn more" - the system should allow:
- Adding new impact areas
- Adding new violence types
- Adding new intervention types
- Without requiring code changes (configuration-driven)

## Critical Questions This Raises for Thursday

### 1. Research vs. Operations
**"Is the platform primarily a research tool for 10Seven, or an operational tool for chapters?"**
- Chapters need: Simple data entry, grant reports
- 10Seven needs: Statistical analysis, correlations, research outputs
- Can one platform serve both? Or are these two different products?

### 2. Taxonomy Management
**"Who controls the taxonomies (violence types, impact types, etc.)?"**
- Can chapters add their own categories?
- Or must they use 10Seven's controlled vocabulary?
- What if a chapter's program doesn't fit the framework?

### 3. Data Quality for Research
**"What validation is needed to ensure research-quality data?"**
- Required fields for research vs. optional for operations?
- Data quality checks?
- Review/approval process before data used in research?

### 4. Statistical Tools
**"What statistical analysis capabilities are needed in the platform?"**
- Just basic (percentages, averages)?
- Or advanced (correlations, regressions, multivariate analysis)?
- Or export to Qualtrics/SPSS for analysis?

### 5. Trauma Graph Integration Specifics
**"How exactly does geographic data 'overlay on Traumagraph™'?"**
- Automated matching by zip code?
- Manual selection of relevant trauma graph data?
- Real-time API calls or pre-loaded data sets?

## Updated Understanding of Platform Purpose

### Primary Purpose:
**Build research infrastructure that makes it easy for YWCA chapters to contribute research-quality data about their impact, while also benefiting from that data for their own grant writing and program improvement.**

### Secondary Benefits:
- Chapters get grant-ready reports
- Chapters discover what others are doing
- National HQ gets network-wide view
- 10Seven gets research data for publishing

### Success Metric:
**Can 10Seven publish peer-reviewed research on YWCA's collective impact based on platform data?**

## The Sophistication Level

This framework reveals:
- PhD-level social science research design
- Grounded in academic literature (they cite bibliography)
- Sophisticated understanding of systemic change
- Measurement of hard-to-measure concepts (power, oppression, privilege)

**Implication:** The platform needs to reflect this sophistication in its data model while hiding that complexity from end users who just want to enter their program data.

---

## Platform Design Challenge

**The core tension:**
- Make it simple enough for a 2-person volunteer chapter to use
- Make it sophisticated enough to support academic research
- Make it operational enough for grant writing
- Make it analytical enough for correlational studies

**The solution:**
- **UI Layer:** Simple, intuitive, "data intranet" feel
- **Data Layer:** Structured, validated, research-quality
- **Reporting Layer:** Multiple outputs (grant reports for chapters, research exports for 10Seven, policy briefs for HQ)
- **Analysis Layer:** Statistical tools available but not required

## Next Steps for Chris

### Updated Questions for Thursday:

1. **"I see this is research infrastructure. What's the balance between research needs and operational needs?"**

2. **"The framework has 4 impact pillars, 3 impact types, 3 violence types. How rigidly should the platform enforce these categories?"**

3. **"You plan correlation analysis across many variables. What statistical capabilities need to be in the platform vs. exported to other tools?"**

4. **"Should chapters be exposed to the impact framework (pillars, violence types, etc.) or should we abstract it?"**

5. **"The glossary has precise definitions. Should the platform have built-in help/tooltips with these definitions?"**

### Updated Architecture Considerations:

**Must Have:**
- Controlled vocabularies (taxonomies)
- Data validation against framework
- Statistical analysis or export capabilities
- Geographic data for trauma graph overlay
- Multiple reporting outputs (operational + research)

**Nice to Have:**
- AI/ML to suggest program categorizations
- Automated coherence checks (does evidence match claimed impact?)
- Integration with academic research tools
- Bibliography/citation management for research outputs
