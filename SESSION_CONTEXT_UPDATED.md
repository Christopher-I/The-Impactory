# Session Context - The Impactory Project (UPDATED AFTER THURSDAY CALL)

**Last Updated**: After Thursday call analysis
**Status**: Complete pivot in project understanding
**Next Step**: Monday follow-up meeting (11am PST) + waiting for materials from team

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: Everything Changed After Thursday Call

### What I Understood Before Thursday:
Project was for YWCA (196 chapters), replacing 61-page survey, helping write grants. Chris hired to build for YWCA.

### What It Actually Is (After Thursday):
Project is for 10Seven's internal research work. YWCA is just one white-label client (secondary). Chris hired to build 10Seven's research infrastructure.

**Chloe literally said**: "Clients be damned. We should be building for us and retrofitting to clients. Our biggest revenue generator is the trauma graph."

## The Real Project: Three Products

### 1. Internal Data Warehouse - "The Patient Chart System" (PRIORITY #1)
**For**: 10Seven internal team only (never shared with clients)
**Purpose**: Collaborative research platform where insights accumulate over time

**The Analogy**: Hospital patient chart - see all labs, but also every doctor's notes from every visit. Click on Philadelphia and see what Chloe discovered 3 years ago, when, and why.

**Core Features**:
- Real-time collaborative qualitative coding (like Google Docs, not siloed like Max QDA)
- Highlight transcript → tag with code → auto-tally across interviews
- Split screen: transcript + field notes
- Living insights attached to geographic locations
- Version history: what changed, when, why
- Team sees each other working in real-time
- Automated map coloring from severity spreadsheet

### 2. Trauma Graph (PRIORITY #2 - Revenue Generator)
**For**: Clients who pay to license access (view only)
**Purpose**: Interactive maps + entire research ecosystem

**NOT just a map**. It's:
- Data collection → qualitative coding → quantitative analysis
- Theme identification → geographic mapping → severity levels
- Map visualization → insights repository → version history
- Client licensing (view insights, never raw data)

**The Vision**: Every neighborhood in US eventually has complete trauma data. Clients commission graphs, all feeds into one living system.

### 3. White Label for Clients (SECONDARY - Build Later)
**For**: YWCA and future clients
**Purpose**: Simplified data storage + optional trauma graph access

**For YWCA**: Data entry, simple queries, replace endless surveys. Optional paid add-on for trauma graph.

**Andrea's quote**: "I just want to build YWCA so they can leave us alone. They're not in a rush to do anything ever."

## Current Pain Points (Why They Need This)

### #1: Max QDA Is NOT Collaborative (Critical)
- Says it's collaborative, but glitches with multiple users
- Field notes are siloed per person
- Can't see each other's work until done
- Forces Chloe to code all her own interviews

**What they need**: Real-time collaboration like Google Docs for research.

### #2: Manual Map Coloring (High)
- Clicked all 3,000 US counties by hand in Adobe Illustrator
- Used iPad to drag colors into St Paul neighborhoods
- Completely manual, extremely tedious

**What they need**: Feed spreadsheet → system auto-colors map.

### #3: No Living Repository of Insights (High)
- Insights only in Chloe's head or final reports
- Team gets updates "second-hand after it's done"
- Can't see historical decisions from 3 years ago
- No version history
- Texting articles to each other (not captured)

**What they need**: Click on neighborhood → see all historical notes/insights + version history.

---

## Their Research Workflow (Step by Step)

1. **Survey & Data Collection**: 500+ respondents, 100+ per geographic area
2. **Qualitative Interviews**: Pay participants, record, take field notes
3. **Qualitative Coding**: Highlight → tag with codes → identify saturated themes (top 3-5 by tally)
4. **Quantitative Analysis**: Correlations, regression (independently, then compare with qualitative)
5. **Geographic Mapping**: Cross-reference themes with zip codes/neighborhoods
6. **Severity Assignment**: Level 1-4 based on rules and qualitative judgment
7. **Map Coloring**: Color counties/neighborhoods by severity (currently manual)
8. **Write Report**: Synthesize insights into narrative

**Can be automated**: Code tallying, theme ranking, geographic matching, severity assignment, map coloring, version history

**Must stay manual**: Reading transcripts, creating codes, consolidating similar codes, severity judgment, finding base maps, writing insights

## The "Patient Chart" Analogy (Critical Concept)

**Chloe's words**: "Like a patient chart at a hospital. You see labs, but also doctor's notes from each visit. Person coming on shift next can read: what was the last doctor thinking? That's what this needs to be."

**What this means**:
- Living knowledge system (not just database)
- Insights accumulate over time
- Click on location → see everything ever discovered there
- Version history: what changed, when, why
- Team adds notes as they discover new things
- No more 2-hour lectures to get people up to speed

**Andrea's addition**: "Click on state, zoom to county, zoom to neighborhood. At each level, read what Chloe wrote, add my own notes, respond, attach NY Times articles."

---

## The Business Strategy Shift

**Current**: Take on client consulting (YWCA, etc.). Good at it, not scalable.

**Future**: Build internal research platform. Pump out trauma graphs. License access. Turnkey products.

**The Vision**:
- Every neighborhood in US has trauma data eventually
- Clients commission trauma graphs
- All feeds into one living system
- Clients pay to license access (view insights, never raw data)
- Stop one-off consulting, focus on scalable products

**Chloe's quote**: "If the trauma graph gets built, we don't have to take on YWCA anymore unless we really want to. It will position me where I should be - pumping out research."

---

## Priority Decision: What to Build First

**Team Consensus**:
1. Internal data warehouse FIRST
2. Trauma graph SECOND (requires warehouse)
3. White label for YWCA THIRD (retrofit later)

**Why**: Trauma graph is revenue generator. YWCA isn't in a rush. Stop prioritizing clients. Build what 10Seven needs first.

---

## Technical Feasibility

**Can This Be Built?** ✅ Yes

**Complexity**: 7/10 (Medium-High, but nothing impossible)
**Business Feasibility**: 8/10 (High - clear revenue model, real pain points)
**Risk**: 4/10 (Medium-Low - internal first, clients later, proven model)

## Next Steps

### Waiting For (From Team):
- Chloe: Step-by-step trauma graph process + St Paul report (severity levels)
- Andrea: Architecture sketches (how products connect) + brand access flow
- Team: YWCA grant examples (if available)

### To Do (Chris):
- Define standardized language for how three products communicate
- Send architecture suggestions after receiving materials
- Prepare for Monday follow-up (11am PST)

## What Changed From My Previous Understanding

### Before Thursday:
- ❌ Project was for YWCA
- ❌ Helping 196 chapters replace survey
- ❌ Grant writing was core
- ❌ Trauma graph was add-on for YWCA
- ❌ You were hired to build for YWCA

### After Thursday:
- ✅ Project is for 10Seven (internal research)
- ✅ YWCA is white-label client (secondary)
- ✅ Qualitative coding collaboration is core
- ✅ Trauma graph + internal warehouse IS the product
- ✅ You were hired to build 10Seven's platform

## Key Quotes from Thursday Call

**Chloe on Priority**:
> "Clients be damned. We've always prioritized them. I think we should start deprioritizing them compared to what we need. Our biggest revenue generator that we've never tapped is the trauma graph."

**Chloe on The Decision**:
> "We need to build a trauma graph. To build it, we technically need to build our internal data warehouse. But I think we should retrofit everything to our clients. Build our stuff, everything else is retrofitted."

**Andrea on YWCA**:
> "I just want to build YWCA so they can leave us alone. The dynamic is fraught. I'd love to hand them something simple. But honestly, they're not in any rush. They're not in a rush to do anything ever."

**Andrea on Vision**:
> "It's one big central platform for everything we make. What we make can be accessed by clients if they want to pay us to access it. It just sells itself."

**Chloe on Patient Chart**:
> "I think of it like a patient chart at a hospital. You can see all their labs, but also the doctor's notes. The person coming on shift next can see: what was that person thinking? That's what it needs to be."

## Bottom Line (Updated)

**What you're building**: Collaborative research platform for 10Seven's internal work. NOT a YWCA project.

**Three products (priority order)**:
1. Internal data warehouse ("patient chart system") - BUILD FIRST
2. Trauma graph (interactive maps for licensing) - BUILD SECOND
3. White label for clients (YWCA version) - BUILD THIRD

**Build order**: Internal first, clients later. "Build our stuff, retrofit to clients."

**Business model**: Stop consulting, license trauma graph access, Chloe pumps out research, turnkey products.

**Feasibility**: Yes (7/10 complexity), solid business (8/10), low risk (4/10).

**Your role**: Build 10Seven's internal research infrastructure. YWCA is a side project to retrofit later.

**The Big Reveal**: Everything I understood before Thursday was wrong. This is 10Seven's platform, not YWCA's.
