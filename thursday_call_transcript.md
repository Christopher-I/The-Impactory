Hello, oh, I'm here just grabbing my food. Yeah, no worries.
I, like, completely forgot we did a naming exploration for or YWCA for, like, their data dashboard. Do you remember this where you, um, maybe, before you join,
I don't remember with the team. You mean,
Dr Blue and Margaret,
like everyone got together and kind of envisioned what it might be like. Is that you mean?
Yeah, like, because we have the Impactory for us. But that was something that came up in the naming exploration. And Kilauea was like, I want that for for our thing.
Oh, interesting. But of course,
I went back to the email chain, and they never chose a name, because they never respond to anything.
But, oh, Nina, exploration, for their version of,
yes, their version this
is ringing about when did that happen?
Like, last fall, like a year ago. Okay,
never mind. I wasn't here, yeah. Or maybe, like, just, I was just start, you know, I was, like, in the
beginning, Nina Andrea.
How's your week going? Pretty good. Yeah, nothing much going on. I am getting ready for Boone to on a trip in about a month, much needed vacation.
Amazing. I'll be
going to Thailand for about but aside that just work, just trying to get done as possible,
that's amazing. How long have you been to Thailand before?
No, first time in Asia.
Wow, that's so exciting. I'll be so good.
I really want to go.
I've never been either. I would love to go. I've never been to Southeast Asia.
Yeah. Have you been to Asia? Any parts of Asia
I have, yeah, I spend a little bit of time in like China and Tokyo Kyoto, and my brother lived in Taiwan for a little bit. I was there, but I feel like there's so much to see.
Yeah,
I've had a layover in Beijing, chaotic airport I've ever been to. Yeah, because my flight arrived, I was going to Australia. My flight arrived late, and they had two hours, you know, to get through, like customs and like my other flight. But the airport is huge. The customs line was so long, so I had to sprint, like, across the airport. Yeah, and they were closing the gates as I got there. So that was my experience. The Beijing Airport was everything was I was surprised, because I feel like in Asian countries, things are so efficient, but like, it was much not it was also, like 10 years ago.
So yeah, I imagine the airport is pretty big, huge. I
nearly, like, started hyperventilating because I was running so fast. Like, I've never run that fast.
Yeah, I've had a few of those
humbling than running through the airport, like, with your back. Yes, it's, like, so embarrassing, but also sweating.
Sweating profusely and like I haven't it's like a 13 hour flight to another 13 hour flight. So if I miss it, like a whole day of vacation, yeah.
Anyways, well, thanks for joining everybody. Um, I'm fine to Chris, let you lead with your questions or whatever. I guess just from our vantage point, by the way, everybody Chris and I were talking just a little bit before this from more of a business strategy lens. And So Andrea, I know that you and I have been working on this, you know, realistically, for eight years. But so he might sprinkle in questions related to that. But kind of, what I ultimately told him, which I think is, you know, you and all three of us have been saying this, but I think that I've needed the push we I think stars are aligning now that we have a Chris right, that at this point we really should be building for us and kind of retrofitting what we build to our clients, because at the end of the day, we pitched our clients what we're delivering to them, so I don't think they know any better, right? And so I'm happy for us to talk about YWCA and what we ultimately, like need to deliver for them. That's still going to be important. But I think that we really should be focusing on, like, what is going to be in the best interest, business interest, financial interest, impact interest of 10 seven, and how do we, just like, make sure that we're building things that could retrofit some of the things that we need to deliver for our clients in order to build this?
Yeah, that's really helpful information. She said, you and I spoke for a few minutes before this. So just going a bit further into that, I would love to hear a bit more about your processes as they currently exist, like, how do you what's the process that you walk through when you are creating a research paper, releasing it, storing that data, sharing that data. What does that look like? Yeah.
And now that I think about that question, I actually wrote this out earlier this year, so I'll make sure I give that to you, Chris, if you all remember when we tried to put things in like motion or whatever, but to answer the question, so from start to finish, the first thing that we do is we update our survey questions. So Nina and I are about to do this exercise, and so it starts with our survey. So that's all going to be, all the quantitative data we collect, typically our survey, well, not typically our survey lives on Qualtrics, although we have found an alternative platform that's way cheaper, because depending on, like, if we get funding, and they say, we need you to do this in Atlanta, we obviously then need to make sure that we're getting people in Atlanta. And so we usually end up hiring a firm who can just, like, blast it out to a bunch of people in Atlanta. But then we also, like, leverage partners that we know in the area to say, hey, we're trying to investigate financial trauma in your area. Can you send this out to the people that you know that are willing to, like take this so that's on the quantitative side, to be honest, to update the survey, we literally just like work in Google Docs or word but again, it would be nice if it all kind of could be in one place. So it's really just about like, do we want to update questions? Do we want to update the scales that we're using, or whatever? Do we want new sections, anything like that? So then we end up Nina will then go in and actually build if we need to update anything in Qualtrics with skip logic and all of that fun stuff. So that, I think will, again, I don't know what it would take, but like, I assume we'll always have to use a platform for that. But if you're kind of like, it's actually quite easy to build a survey platform that we can blast out a link to cool, I don't know, but if you know, whatever. Then from there, that's just kind of in autopilot as people are submitting their answers. We'll look at that every once in a while, just to make sure that we're kind of getting the numbers that we need. For me, I really, really try to get at least 500 respondents before I'm comfortable doing anything in terms of building a map. I'd obviously love more than that. But like my magic number is 500 and that part of that 500 I need, I would like to have at least 100 in certain geographic spaces, so whether that's all the way down to the neighborhood level or like parts of a city. So for me, it's like if we did one for New York City, I would want at least 100 per borough in order for me to feel like I can do something like map wise. And then on top of that, we do qualitative interview. So on the survey, we people can sign up to actually have real, inter live interviews with us. Or this is also where we leverage partners, where they'll help facilitate focus groups, because I'm very adamant about having quantitative and qualitative data. The, I think wonderful thing that we do with our qualitative data partners is we, typically, we try our best funding, permitting, to pay people for their time to do the qualitative so in order to get paid, you have to, obviously do the qualitative interview, and you have to take the survey so we can get double the data. And then those are just that. That is our bread and butter. Nina can speak to this. We are actually about to publish something we did in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and like the listening to people's stories is what brings everything to life. And then that's also where we get consent that if we obviously recording it, some of them may actually allow us to use their voices for that immersive kind of element. Now that we've collected all the data, we then start to code it so we do our typical quantitative analysis. Typically, we do that on Qualtrics, because I like their stats IQ. But again, we can really do that anywhere. Allison does it on SPSS. I can do it on R any of those platforms are fine. We're really just kind of running correlational analyzes, regression analyzes, the usual. We're not doing crazy quantitative reasoning, but, like, it's pretty in depth. And then on the qualitative side, I sent you the video of me going through Max QDA, but also sent you those platforms so you see that it's really just like, it's kind of like Kindle in some way, right? Like you highlight the sentence that you think is relevant, and you code it as, hey, this was a very traumatizing event for them, or this, or whatever theme we think is coming up. What I love about Max QDA on like the other platforms that I've used before is you can see the ticker at all times across all of your data set. So I can start to see that like, wow, housing being a traumatizing event in this area is is a saturated theme among this group, because it keeps coming up. And so that's what I really liked about Max QDA, but again, I'll leave it to you to decide if you think that that's easy to build or not. I'm happy to again, keep using it, but I think for me, it's just something as simple as you have to highlight the sentence that we're reading through. It should allow us to tag it. That tag then goes into some type of a database that keeps a tally across every single interview so that you can ultimately find a saturated theme, which is how you do qualitative reasoning. And so once we've done all of that, we then have the quantitative data and the qualitative data speak to each other. I don't, so I, in other words, I analyze both sets of data independently of each other, because I end up feeling like sometimes I will get an insight on the quantitative side that then informs how I want to continue my qualitative side and vice versa. Then we have all of our themes and all these other things. And then to your point. Now, what we're going to do is we will build an outline that of all of the themes, and what we think is kind of making sense, and at this point,
when you say themes, can you speak a bit more into that?
Yeah, so I think about themes in terms of this is where we found out about people were monitoring their bank accounts more than, you know, 20 hours a week in St Paul, Minnesota, that just ended up being a theme on the quantitative and the qualitative side. And we found out that those overlapped. So it seems to me, are kind of like, what are the actual data insights that we can glean from this particular area that might be unique to this area. And so really, the part of the reason, again, why Max PDA is so helpful to me is when I start to see that like 50 people talked about the same thing, because it kept a tally of everything that I coded that becomes a theme. I'm like, Oh, well, if 50 people brought it up, this must be incredibly relevant. Yeah, the other thing that I'll quickly mention is on the quantitative side and the qualitative side, I am asking people about either their zip code or their neighborhood. Frank, actually, I do both, so that when I also pull all of those themes, I then start to see, are they thematic from a geographic lens as well. So it's not just that it's happening across the city, but now I actually see that it's concentrated with people in this specific neighborhood that is where the mapping starts. So I will then go back and see okay, if 40 people talked about a traumatizing banking event, I'm going to go then pull what their zip codes were, and if there seems to be that 20% of them are coming from the same zip code, boom. I know. I'm going to plot a certain severity in that area, and then I create kind of like an index measure. So I'll be honest, it is a very manual process, but I think that that's actually important. There's not a lot that can be automated on that end, except for, again, the automation for me is as soon as I tally something under a specific code, or under a specific zip code or neighborhood or whatever. If that can be automated for me, that going to save me a lot of time, but when it comes to actually building the map itself, there has to be a lot of kind of hand or manual work, which I think is okay, because I think that allows us to be just more judicious about the kind of things that we're dealing with. But I don't think I said it to you, but I will. I'll send you our big report from St Paul, namely, because one of the sections brings through how I label things, a level 123, and four on the severity map. So eventually I can get to the point where I'm saying, if greater than 40% of the respondents from this particular neighborhood exhibit these things, then it's a level four, which is the highest severity, or if only 30% then it's a level three, and so on and so forth. So I can give you that, and again, that can be automated, like once I've identified that in the data, then it can maybe auto plot it for me, but that has to be done manually before anything can be automated from there. So then we now have all the data, we can put it into an outline, and then we can essentially, like, report on what we're finding. So as you're kind of writing the report, I'm also like building the map. And like I said, this has been the most tedious part, and I do think could probably we could use technology for but, like, I literally have hand colored on Adobe Illustrator on an iPad every single neighborhood or county in the country to with the color, with the correct color. Yes, so I will either go on to Adobe Illustrator and click on each of the 3000 counties in America, because I have 3000 answers now to each county, and I will click on it and press the color, which I know is not efficient, but with St Paul, for example, because we got down all the way to the neighborhood level, I used the app procreate, which a lot of artists use. I like dump the map in there, and I literally drag and drop the color into the street. So again, like something we could definitely do a better job of, especially because, like, on the quantitative side, like we collect the, what's it called, all of their geographic information, so I can, like, literally pinpoint exactly, like where they are. In my qualitative interviews, I usually ask where they have moved throughout the city. So I can actually create migration maps, which I think would be really cool. But anyway, that's the process. It's very long, and I do think again, we can only make it so short, and I am not going to sacrifice on that. But there are definitely parts where I'm like, this could be automated. Like, again, I could give you a spreadsheet of 3000 answers, and then the model should be able to be like, Oh, great, that's a level three. I'm going to go change the color in that geo tag, as opposed to me doing it.
Yeah, yeah.
And I think the other thing is, too, is as Chloe's talking it through, like she's kind of doing this stuff individually, yeah, in storing it on her different platforms. So like Nina and I kind of get it second hand when it's done or progress. So my, my take, my top line is that it'll also help to be able to see her working on this stuff while she's working on it, versus us, kind of, like needing to rely on to get a map from her. Or, you know, Oh, where did we do this? Like, map, geographic thing, and then her sending it to us. So, like, the idea that, like, we could also be a part of the process too, correct, be really helpful. And
that is the problem with Max QDA. So they they mark it as if they have a platform where you can see like Google Docs. You can see me working on it. It does not work like that, Chris, because Nina, I got it from Nina, Nina, and it doesn't matter like it does not update like Google Docs. It's just not a thing. So in other words, if you start qualitative coding on something and you think that the other person will finish it for you, that's not happening, because you cannot see it like that. You have to finish your own work. But you know, I've trained Nina now on how to qualitatively code, we should be able to work on it together simultaneously and we cannot, yeah, and frankly, I have yet to find a platform that lets me do it like that. Now, again, this is literally something you could, in theory, do on Google Docs. In other words, I can highlight a sentence in Google Docs and make a comment, and My comment would be the code. The problem with that is, I then, now have to go back to all of my comments and put it in a spreadsheet and tally it myself. But you can imagine that, like, from a tech perspective, could we build something where, when you make it a comment, it just like, goes to a repository that calculates when I say this word multiple times, right? So, like, if people are trying, you know, back in my grad school days, when we were trying to save money, save money and not buy a software, we would just do it in Google Docs. But then you then have to download, or you have to count, really, we would print it out, print out the piece of paper, and then write a tally sheet of all of the comments that had our codes on it, and then, like, literally, write a tally So Max QDA does that for you, but it's not interactive, so like Nina and Andrea can't join the process until I'm done. Yeah, that's a problem. Yeah.
At what point of the process is this? So is this the color coding process? At what stage do you necessarily when you need to collect?
That's early, so basically, as soon as the data is collected, yeah, it's then, it's before I even start coloring or anything. And again, could definitely speed things up, because again, like for me, even if with Allison. Right, so Allison does a lot of our quantitative analyzes, and Qualtrics also does not do this kind of simultaneous type thing unless, which is what, how Allison and I do it, we share a login, and I'll let her go run the analyzes and I just look at it so there's there's no collaborative feature like my team can do a lot of the analyzes. I then have to take the analyzes, synthesize it, and make it what it is into the map, and that's where I should be focused on, obviously, whereas unfortunately, it just it falls apart because the tools don't exist for us to like, do it simultaneously with each other. Yeah, I don't care what anybody says. We have tried every I've tried every platform under the sun. People are like, oh, yeah, you can do it at the same time. Like, no, you can't even the Atlas ti that I sent you that's a little bit better. Like, at least it shows up, but like, it's not really time stamped, if Nina and I are in there at the same time, it glitches. Like, it's just not, yeah,
okay to go a bit further into this specific pain. Point aside coding these keywords, are there any other other activities that you need to collaborate on with Nina and Andrea.
Um, I don't know if collaborate maybe. So the only other thing that I mentioned in my quick video was so I and I encourage my team to do the same. Take note. Even though the qualitative interview is being recorded, I encourage us all to take notes. And usually the reason why I do that so those are called Field Notes. Field Notes are actually really important because they at least the methodologies that I follow are also data. And the reason why I use my field notes is because I actually will note to myself when somebody starts crying, for example, and I then use that to bump up against some other codes to, like, really identify, like, this was a really traumatizing moment for her that, like, you can't get on a PDF transcript, like, you know, like you don't hear the sniffle. Or, depending on if we were in person and at a certain place, like, or I've was at somebody's home and they pointed to a trinket or something, I would write that in my field notes. So Max QDA does have a place where you can upload your field notes, but again, because it's siloed, like Nina and Andrea, can't see that in the file, so I only get access to my field notes on, you know, Nina only gets access to her field notes. And that's another kind of issue, yeah,
okay, which,
again, would then force me to have to code the people that I interviewed. Because I would then, of course, want to be able to Nina to see my field notes, so as she's coding, she can, you know, look at them side by side. That may also be a nice part, which is, like, can you have the transcript on one side where it's coding and then, like, it's a split screen on the other side it has the field notes up next to it, like, that would probably be nice, so you can see them back and forth. That would be hugely helpful. Because I think at the end of the day, like, what I've had to do is I'll go to Nina and be like, Okay, I'm gonna code this person, this person, and this person. And it's because I just know that, like I took those field notes, it's gonna be too hard for her to decipher. I can't get it in the right file for her. And so I ended up just being like, Screw it. We have to stick with the people that we did interviews for.
Yeah, yeah. When you say code, what do you mean?
Exactly, yes. Thank you. So not tech code. Coding is really just categorizing. So like I said, you highlight the sentence. And here's a good example. At the beginning of the transcript that you're reading, you'll be like, can you please state your name? My name is Chloe McKenzie, okay, great. Can you please tell me what neighborhood you grew up in I grew up in such and such neighborhood and whatever. So what I would do in the transcript there is, I would highlight the neighborhood. So when I highlight it, it then allows me to click on it and says, Create new code. And that code, I would say, you know, Mackenzie neighborhood. And so every single time I now code in any other transcript, McKenzie neighborhood, I'll be able to see a tally of how many people grew up in this neighborhood. Does that make? So the code is really, I'm categorizing something from the transcript,
and then all those codes get populated, like, separate, like, then we can just look through the codes essentially, and understand, oh, wow, we, you know what? Closing about the saturation, like 50 people mentioned housing insecurity or or if we want to make sure that we're tracking like a certain emotion, or, like Chloe said zip code, then we can also use it in that way too, but it's just a way to kind of like, kind of use that data in a kind of impactful way. And
I think why this is important is because I again, take a very thorough approach. It's just how I was taught by my mentors. We then end up coding the codes, because some codes might actually overlap, and so we give it a better title, and that's how we kind of collate them. Nina, while you're in front of your computer. Do you mind I emailed it earlier, so I wasn't expecting anybody to have looked at it yet, because it was very soon ago. But can you bring up my video? Because and then you can just, like, pause it somewhere, and I can actually show that we're not speaking about in the abstract. Show you what that looks like. But so what we do is we we do what we call the first round of coding, and then we go back and we actually review every single code and see, are there two codes that are very similar that could be recoded? So that's why that's also really important for us to figure out. What are the themes?
Yeah, if you can show me this in match QDA, that would be,
yes. Okay, great. So
can you see my screen?
I can. Okay,
of course, it's like, a little bright. But do you see at the bottom left? It says codes, yeah. And then let the let the thing play Nina, because I get to a point where it's like, that's only I'm able to do is highlight. Listen to myself
here. I'll turn it off.
No, it's okay. I think that's actually useful.
All of my codes are down here, and this is across every single interview. And so what happens is it tabulates. So let me give you a good example. It tabulates here, so like, this is one of our saturated themes a meaningful community, because it shows up 11 times across all of the different interviews. And so this helps me identify where we are seeing common threads and themes. And so this is why I really like mass PDA, it's like very simple to be honest, but most of the quality, all of their qualitative softwares, like, are just overly complicated, very jumbled. This is just like, very simple and beautiful. I can go into my log book when I take notes during the sessions. Those are called Field Notes. I can put my field notes in here. This also has like, really cool features where it can make me maps of different document variables, which I think, okay, you can stop it there, Nina and let me just be let me be clear about what I meant by maps. So they're called Word maps. So again, if I wanted to see a visualization of how many times a code showed up, that's what I mean by a map, but if you're looking at a screen right now, so notice that blue highlight. So I highlighted those sentences and then see the code to the left. That is what I coded it as. And that code shows up in that repository in the bottom left hand corner. The nice thing too is in that bottom left hand corner, if I were to click on one of those codes, it shows me what I highlighted across all of the things. So in other words, it like I can click on the number two, and I can see the two places across the two interviews where I made that code. So it's really just like highlighting and I type in, okay, this is the code and that's it. But what I love about it is it tracks codes, but it also tracks notice, there's the blue, and then down below there's a yellow. So even if I highlight something, usually what I do is I code things that actually are for the process of doing what's called thematic analysis. But sometimes, like, somebody says something and I'm just like, wow, remember Nina, I like, told you that we have a code called Wow. I usually highlight those in yellow because I just think that those are really good quotes we could use in a report, or really good quotes that we could put in the immersive experience. So some people may, like, literally, just say things I'm, like, speechless about. I don't have a code for it. There's not really, like a theme there, but it's like, we should put this somewhere, yeah, but it's a very simple interface, like all these other platforms, really, let's be real. At the end of the day, academia tries to hate on qualitative data, which is why there's very few qualitative softwares. Everybody wants quant, quant, quant, and so there literally are, like, I don't know, four or five qualitative softwares on the market, many of which are, like, very antiquated and awful. Max QDA is one of the newer ones on the market, and I do like it, but, like I said, it has its flaws. But I also will be kind of honest, like a lot of qualitative researchers don't have teams, so I think it works for a lot of people because they're working solo. But when you are doing an operation like we are like, it has to be more collaborative.
Very useful. Thank you. Do you have? How do you do you have some sort of guide on your codes? What's it based like, how do you Nina and Andrea agree on? Like, what a code looks like? Is it based on, like you mentioned, like, there is a wow code. Like, how do you collaborate on that? Like, is there?
So, yeah, that's a that's a great question. So again, our methodology follows my mentors, which is, we don't have one, and I think that it's because we let we, we let the data tell us. So part of the reason why it is a requirement that we're able to collaborate in the platform. Is because that is why we do multiple rounds of coding. So the first round of coding is literally like, we are just reading for the first time the transcript and writing a code that just comes to our mind, and then that is why we then download the codes, and that is when we conference together. Of like, I think this code, in this code are actually saying the same thing. So let's change it to this name so that. So each actual time we are creating our own system of codes, makes sense.
Makes sense, okay, all right. All right. That makes sense. So from this point you have the codes. You compare the codes how, what's the next step that you take?
The next step from there is quantitative and could be more on the automated side of things, which is we literally just pick the codes that have the most tallies next to it, because that is how you do it, right? If it, if it shows up more often than anything else, that is what is called a saturated theme, and therefore it the data is telling you, this is what you need to focus on as your insight. So we will pick again. There's some kind of discretion here, but usually you pick the top three to five based on tally. It also depends on your sample size. But from there, like, if you could, if there's just, like, a ranked, ordered list, like, these are your top five themes, great. And then at that point, we just have to refresh ourselves about like, what did people say, and what was the experience like, and whatever. And that's what I was saying, that we take those themes and then I will go back and actually say, Okay, where did these people live? Where are they on the map of this city? So again, I do feel like that could potentially be automated, because as Max QDA records it. It does know which interview that came from. And in that interview, I obviously highlight the zip code in the neighborhood that they're from. So if there was a way for you know, the technology to, like, do that work for me? Great. So that's to me, I'm thinking some coding on your end. But like, if it could tell me, great, Hey, your top theme is this, and it's spit out a report that's like, and this is this theme is happening in these neighborhoods. Awesome, because that's really what you do next, right?
The insight, okay, so you're basically comparing you, getting the insight from the qualitative and quantitative data, and trying to make sense of it. Okay, yes, okay, okay. So after you do that, you have your insight, you have your report. So that's data that can be stored and used and mapped. Yes, what else do you do with that data? Is that, is there another step in the process?
The only other step then would be giving it a severity. So what is and again, I'm definitely going to send you the report that we do, because severities and phenomenon, to me, are two different things. So one the themes are really giving you like, what is happening when people participate in the economy. And then I some of it Yes, is a judgment call, so I don't pretend to say that like everything again. This is why I don't rely heavily on quantitative but qualitatively what actually might seem worse. So, you know, sorry for the trigger warning here, but like there was actually one of the saturated themes in St Paul was that people were actually, like, doing self harm, like against themselves, like cutting when they got unexpected bills. Like, that was a theme. And so then I'm like, Is that happening in a particular area, one place over another? Thank you. Andrea, is that happening in a place, one place over another? So that's really the next step. Is just kind of like, how do we, like, really craft this narrative and then plotting the scenarios into what Andrea is showing you? Like, I literally Chris clicked all 3000 of those tracks on that map and colored it the different shades of purple,
like this map that I'm looking at, like I
all of the maps show show them the next one. Andrea, so then we do what's called multi dimensional maps. And so I clicked all 3000 of those two and colored them. Yeah. So to your point again, this is where I could just go into a spreadsheet. I have the answers, and all 3000 of those does have a number one through four next to it. Yeah. So somebody can, you know something, the tech can literally go fill it in the color like I have the color code for you. It can go fill it in for me.
Yeah, yeah. We can definitely make that process a lot easier. Yeah.
I think the main thing will be the back end work, because this is also part of you talk about a step I have to go find the right map that I want to use. So this one was based on us counties, and so the resource I sent you the like map resource, or whatever, like, I licensed this map from them because they have clickable maps that you can license that has all 3000 counties. But when you're down at the city level, you know, I usually end up going through the city's website, like they have a map of the city that I pull from the city's website, because I just think it's the most up to date. Usually they have a map that has zip codes on it or whatever, like, I just have to find a really good, clean, what I call base map, and then I start coloring from there. And that does require some manual work too, because there's not just, like, one place that has every map of every city down to the neighborhood level. So we have to go find that. And then I think what would be the coding part? Tech speak here, the coding part is we would then need to label all of the sections that we want colored, if that made sense. Thank you. Andrea, I figure you're bringing up, are you bringing up the st, Paul, one potentially great. Um, could you go to the severity? So that one is a multi dimensional. Could we go to the severity?
Sorry, my computer's freezing Verity this one?
No, that's a multi dimensional. It should be way at the front. Yep, that one. So what this entailed was I got a the base map, which would be all the things that are in black, and then the data obviously told me what nature so this is broken down by neighborhood. So I found a neighborhood map that the City Council provided to me. And so what we would have to code on the back end is all of those, like unique polygons, I guess we can call it. We would have to tell the tech system, or whatever the code base. Hey, this square is number one. This we just need to name everything. So that way, when I gave fed it a spreadsheet, it could plot the severity in the right place.
But yes, this is what this is before I found some of the other, you know, map resources. This one I literally did by hand in an iPad and like dragged in the color
that makes sense in an ideal world. Let's say you had the perfect app that will let you just easily do all of this. What does that look like? Is it a spreadsheet? Do you what does that look like? What's the ideal interaction like, for you,
that's a wonderful question. To me, it's not so I would actually say it's more like, I'm talking the old air table, not the new one. That, like, seems very complicated. It's a, you know, it's like a spreadsheet, but I can, like, put notes and things right. Like, I don't the the issue that I have with, like, saying a spreadsheet, thinking like Excel or Google Sheets. I understand you can click on a cell and type a comment in, but like, that comment gets buried unless you hover over it. So, like, people can miss it really easily. I would like there to be a spreadsheet, but I need somewhere where I can, like, type my thoughts and insights. And that is something that, again, the team would be really necessary for the team that, like, if there is some type of a split screen where you see the data on the left in a spreadsheet, but then we could, I could type in a couple of my bullet points, like, Hey guys, this is what I'm finding. It's finding. It's like, pretty crazy. And people can respond to that, or they went through the data and they're like, I'm also seeing it here, like there's some type of communication thing that allows us to talk about the data as we're looking at it together. Is really the ideal situation for me. I just like air table because it doesn't, well, excuse me, the old air table because it doesn't feel like a spreadsheet. Does that make sense? Like, from a user perspective, I don't want it to just look like an Excel sheet. Like that is just too that's too much numbers, right? Exactly like I just I need there to be more than that going on.
Yeah, I feel like, and as somebody who is not the lead researcher, it's almost like, if I could, like, if I'm want to go, what Chloe said about this thing, whether it's the project we were working on or a past project that she's referencing, like, oh, there's a trend from when we Did Chicago versus like, St Paul, like I could go to the map, I could click on the state, and then I could zoom into the county, if I needed, I could zoom into the neighborhood. And then on each of those levels, I could like, either read what she's written, or like, add notes myself. So for the data that we have in those places, I can easily, like, pull it up, like Chloe said, like, on a split screen, and then maybe there's like, an edit button where I can be adding notes or responding to Chloe's comments or adding data points as like, I see them, or maybe it's like, I saw this really interesting stat, and then the New York Times around a specific nation In this city, and I actually really want to make a note on the trauma graph. That's not necessarily from what we did in our primary research, but it's good secondary data for us to reference. You know, it's like, I feel like, from my perspective, it's similar to Chloe's, but I also want to be able to, like, easily source different data points, but also add to a specific location or city or state as we come up with stuff or as we need to find it.
Yes, I think the main thing for me is like, I think of the analogy of a patient chart at like a hospital system, right? You can see all of their labs and stuff. But you also might put in your note after you did rounds at the hospital with them, so that the person who's coming on shift next can just like, go look at what was that person thinking? Oh, I gave them a Tylenol. Like, that's what it needs to really be, yeah.
It's like my chart, yes, exactly,
history of records and some content
exactly, because, to Andrea's point, she might go see my Philadelphia trauma graph. That's the first one that I built that was, like, three years ago, and I did it by myself. But she shouldn't have to have a two hour conversation with me for me to break it down. She should just be able to see, like, this is what Chloe thought on this day, and this day is where she got this insight from. And, you know, like, it's some type of a record system, but she can click on that neighborhood and then go look at all the things that I typed up. Yeah, and that allows me to also create a system with the team that it's like, if you are gonna go noodle in some data today, you have to write down your thoughts and submit it, and now we have a record of
it, right? No, it makes a lot, which, this gave me a lot of insight into what this thing actually. So it's a living map. Like this is, yes, the information isn't temporary. Like, it's correct. Over time. Okay, that's right.
Commission trauma graphs like, even though we might have one for the city in the city, and three different relationships and partnerships that data we own and we want to put into that living map,
your addition of the New York Times article, fact Andrea, because I feel like we're constantly, like, texting each other things, yes, are interesting, which obviously is like, something we can continue to do, but like, I think if we could somehow capture that information. Like, as you know, we're constantly seeking things that are relevant, because we are always we're trying to make up to date maps. The curriculum that we build is lot like it reflects the current experience today. And so whatever we the capability that we have also needs to allow us to be really dynamic and, like, collect this information.
Well, this guy vision is that every single neighborhood on this in the US is complete with, like, all the data we could ever find.
Yeah,
and that's the reason we have people commission these different trauma graphs, is because we're eventually, we're trying to build that, like, full, complete thing, and to bring up YWCA, so part of the work we were doing with them was doing a national version of the trauma graph, not that it would be the final national version we would ever have, but like our first kind of, like large scale, multi states using their network, like getting all that kind of information, or scale than we're used to. And like having that is also going to be really important for us to store and code and you know, their access to it is something where it's up in the air, as we think about licensing and stuff, but it's like when we have clients like that who may want to, like access that level of data, we'll also want some different like tiering there as well. I think Chloe
right, and like to Andrea's point. So the national trauma of what she showed you, and I told you, I clicked all 3000 counties to color it, the main thing that we're kind of getting at, and why, like, I'm thinking about it as a patient chart system, is there are a lot of counties that are level four. But the reason is very different, very different. So when you click into each of those counties like it's our job to show you why, what's driving the level four in this place versus that place. And so yes, that's going to be necessary for the end user, but I also need the team to know why, and that is what's ultimately missing from our platforms right now, is I essentially have to give a lecture to everybody, like, this is, like, so cool over here, whereas, like, if they were able to just see me putting in those insights, or we have new data that I'm updating, right? Like, I we have that trauma graph for the nation, but I Allison and I totally forgot, we have 532 new women who have taken it, and we haven't even updated it yet, right? So if Allison and I do that, I we want to be able to have that record of, like, what changed? Why did it change? You know, all of that kind of stuff.
Yeah, this is very, very, very useful information. I'm just processing everything you're saying. But this is extremely useful.
Okay? So I think in terms of the media next steps, Chris is I'm gonna get you, I wrote out literally step by step, on how we make a trauma graph. So I think that will obviously be helpful to you. We'll get you the report for St Paul, which I'll just tell you what sections to read, because that will at least break down. Like, how do I color this over that?
Yeah, no, that would be very useful. If you can send that to me. I do have a few more questions.
Is everything I've been saying is, like is, if we build the internal part right, like the our clients will never see the patient charge, right? There's HIPAA, but they might see this, the doctor summary, or whatever, right? Like, you know how we really don't get all the notes from the doctor. We get whatever their summary is right, exactly like that is what we are offering to people via license. But what we really need internally is that whole patient chart system,
yeah, yeah. That's a really good analogy that that makes a lot of sense. Would it? Would it be fair to say that we, the primary data that we're using here is internal data, not that YWCA is data,
yes, okay, it's internal. But again, how we're going to have to retrofit it is YWCA, the white label. Thing we've pitched to them is they will be able to warehouse their own data, right, somewhere. But yes, it is all our internal stuff, okay, that will never share, right? So, yes, you can go click on the maps and you can see our insights and all that other stuff, but you'll never get the data. You'll always get the insight. Yeah,
yeah. And I think the other thing is, which is what, some of what Nina sent you earlier this week from the impact survey like that is not data well, let me rephrase. We designed the survey, collected, the data are doing the analysis, but like, the actual, like data points are being fed from the local association. So it's like that data is YWCA is like, own internal information that we've just collected and analyzed through the survey. So it's not even that they're just getting trauma graph access. They also need a place to like, review all that impact survey data on number of programs and like what programs are doing what and all the stuff that was in the survey, which is something that is not necessarily part of our internal platform, but maybe there's something similar that We have that tracks in a very systematic way, right, that we can copy for them, that works for the kind of data they are tracking, beyond the trauma graph, exactly like, and it's kind of like that conversation we said around now that they're not super sophisticated around data, so it's not even like We need a super complex like, you know, Max QDA, like, I don't know, be lookup situation. Like, it's like, it's really simple for them to go ahead and be like, how many local associations have childcare, and they can easily just pull that number from it. So, like, that's their white label version. Is like a mix of that information and then also what we are licensing through the trauma graph, right? Am I right in saying it that way? Yes, you're right.
Okay, so in terms of the potential offers to the YWCA, there's the part where they can enter information and easily get reports. Does that also include a trauma graph? Or that's a separate piece that they all show that they can
it's an add on so they can license it for a fee. But the idea would be to Andrea's point, how many ywcas have childcare. I want to look at that side by side with 10 sevens financial trauma map that maps childcare deserts, so they would only be able to see that side by side if they license the trauma graph portion of the Impactory.
Right. Okay. Yeah. And it's like to, I think Chloe also mentioned this, but it's like, right now the YWCA organizations, like, they just get so many surveys, and that data that they put into the surveys goes nowhere. So this would also be a great place where it's like, hey, all my local associations, like, please update your information around. Like, random surveys they have. They have is like, how many buildings do you have? A lot of them have housing developments that they manage. So it's like, how many buildings does your thing own? And then, right now, they'll just send out a survey, and everyone has to fill out like a
survey. You can literally do that one time, and
then that's it, yeah, but like, if they had this kind of white labeled platform, they could easily just go in and update, you know, on the platform, like, Okay, we have this many buildings, or we serve this many people. Like, it's less need of a survey, and more, like they can go input their own information when it's requested.
Yeah, okay, I had a conversation with Chloe earlier. She pointed out, I think it sounds like at this point, this is three different products that interact with each other. You have the white label for the YWCA that they can use, you have the trauma graph, and then you have the data repository in this case, and they can all interact with each other. Technically, this is very feasible, like we can definitely build this. I'm thinking maybe we could have more conversations around how these different applications interact with each other, some sort of standard language, and I can Chloe, after you send me the additional information, I can make a few suggestions what that could look like, maybe to spark the conversation around that. But I think once we have once we align on like a common language and what this thing could look and feel like, I think from that point on, we can get more confidence and building this thing out. But so far, it's very feasible, definitely something we can build so
and just for fun, I'm going to pose the question, Andrea and Nina to each of you that Chris posed to me, because I just want to hear your thoughts. And Chris tell me, if I'm not phrasing it the way you did, what what did you say? What order do you think? Yeah, this is kind of a business strategy question, so there's not really a wrong answer, but I'm just curious about everybody else's, and then I'll tell you what mine was. But Chris, do you remember? How did you frame it? You kind of asked me about, like, the order that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
If we have three, these three different products, and we wanted to build out the MVP internally. Do you think one product should come before the other? Like, in what sequence do you think should build out these products if they were individual?
Might be the wrong answer, but I just want to build YWCA so they can leave us alone. No, I'm so serious and like their local associations like so I employee might have explained this to you, but the dynamic between USA, kind of, like the ruling org and their, you know, local associations that are actually doing the work is a little fraught. So it's very contentious because USA doesn't really give them any support, and they're very much like independent children, like trying to raise themselves and doing a very good job, but USA continues to drag their feet, and I feel like the YWCA white label option is pretty simple to build and hand over to Say, Hey, we did this, and it's something they can start doing and using right away. And I think they're also kind of hungry to see their like, I said, the data that we collected from the impact survey like reflected somewhere. Now that being said, I don't know if that's possible, but that's just my my hot take, because I feel like we've been talking about with them for a while, and I'd love to, just like, show them a iteration of what it is actually earlier, because we had a call with them, Chloe requested that I kind of put together some slides that basically redefine what we're delivering To them, because it's been a while since they've talked about it, and they just got funding for us to be able to do it again. So I'm actually going to spend some time, quote, defining it, and maybe, like, drawing some lines around what this idea is today. Obviously, everything is not going to be final, but I think once we are able to do that, maybe that'll also help you as well. But that's my answer. Is I would love to, like, get YWCA what they need and then focus on building what we need. But Chloe, I mean, it could also be that we build what we need and take the time that we need to build it and then give it to them. If they're not in any rush, I don't think they're in any rush to do anything ever.
You can see how we all feel about okay, so technically, Andrea's vote is data warehouse first. Yeah.
YWCA, like build a minimum viable product for them, give it to them, and then once we build our thing, we can update their thing as like an update, you know.
Okay, Nina, what is your answer? Can
I ask a clarifying question? So when you said the three products, you meant the trauma graph, the data warehouse and then white labeling for clients would be the third implication is that we need to build our own data warehouse before we can essentially like white label. I guess
I don't think you need to make that assumption. Okay? And then, just for fun, let's say that there are four products we've already been building. The fourth, which is the ED hub, the education platform. Obviously, that one's being built. So, like, don't count that in your rank. But which one would you build first?
Um, I think, like clients aside, just in terms of, like, internal conversations and our work and what would be, kind of like, most interesting and exciting to me, and be a combination of, like, what we've already been doing and then the data that we are continually collecting, I'd probably say the
trauma graph. Andrea, pretend we don't have clients. Which one would you build first?
Um, the trauma graph. There
you go. Chris, that was my answer. I kind of was like, clients be damned, because we always, understandably, we've always prioritized them, and they don't need to feel neglected. But I think internally, we should start, quote, unquote, neglect, deprioritizing them compared to what we need. Because I was telling Chris our biggest revenue generator that we've never tapped is the trauma graph. If it gets built, we don't have to take on YWCA anymore, unless we really want to again. I understand why we have I have no regrets about it, but it also finally will position us from a business perspective of putting me, Chloe McKenzie, in the place where I should be, which is continuing to pump out the research and all the other stuff, we make the question we we decide as a team how much consulting we want to do. But Andrea, that you and I talked about this, where it's like, what are the turnkey things? Like the ED hub is going to be huge for us. Huge for us too. So I was just kind of like, we've neglected the trauma graph for so long, but it's ultimately how we've gotten everybody Yeah. So I'm also kind of, I hear I agree with you, Andrea, that's why I literally, actually kind of, it was a combination of both of your answers. I said to Chris, we need to build a trauma graph. To build the trauma graph, we technically do need to build our internal data warehouse, because we can't really build a trauma graph without it. But I said I think at this point we should retrofit everything to our clients that works for us. I think we build our stuff and everything else is going to be retrofitted.
Okay, I'm fine with that. But I
was just curious. I figured we'd all ultimately end up having the same answer. But you see, Chris, our conundrum of like, Yeah, let's just get the client thing out of the way, and then we'll, you know, and I think we should just we, we should reverse it's, it's, it's both unnatural to us and natural to us. We just do a good job. We're very good at client stuff, but I know that from a business perspective, we want to move away from that to a certain extent.
Yeah, yeah, no. This makes a lot it makes so much sense. In that case, I think in terms of building out the technical architecture, you know, just like I said before, it's finding this standardized language. What this would allow us to do is, you know, let's say we are building out a trauma graph, and for some reason, we want to pivot and build out the white label. For whatever reason, we can easily do that once we have a rough idea of how these different parts will communicate with each other, if we can establish that we're good,
yeah, I can. I mean, maybe we find time to continue this Convo. But a while
ago, I was gonna say, Andrea, are you getting excited? Yeah, I've
been learning this for so long, but I also like wrote out some, like, architecture stuff from a brand perspective on, like, how people access us just generally. Yeah, if I'm remembering correctly, I might have started to draw out some stuff that might help answer your question. Chris around, like how everything talks to each other and relates, yeah, because it's like, if I'm an education person, I have a login to the Impactory, and I only see the stuff that I've been allowed to see. So maybe my education course that I signed up for, if I'm YWCA, I log in, and maybe I have access to the trauma graph through the license that went my association, green lit. But then I also have access to my Impactory data, and that's all I see. But then, if you're Nina, then you're logging in, and you get to see all of the back end stuff, all of the trauma graph stuff. I feel like it's just like we're kind of seeing it as like one big, central platform for everything that we make, and then what we make can be accessed by our clients. They want to pay us to access it and to close like it just sells itself, yeah, yeah. But if it's helpful, I can go back and look at it and maybe before our next conversation, sketch it out how maybe the world looks like
that'll be amazing, even if it's not, if you don't have all the information. Now, if some of it is aspiration, that's fine, even if it's mock data that you sent to me, fantastic. We can work with that. One thing I mentioned this earlier to Chloe is if, if there's a way to figure out what YMCA needs today, if there are grants, they're applying for whatever, I think that could be really helpful in how we build out the white label solution when we get to that point.
Yeah, yeah, that's fair. And I think Andrea has basically built that, so we'll be able to give that to you.
Okay, sounds good. Super excited. Could we maybe schedule another meeting next week to follow up on this? Yeah? Think we already have a meeting scheduled for Monday, right?
Yeah, we have our weekly sync on Monday at 11, PST, Okay,
sounds good. I guess we could follow up on it. If you can send me the information, I'll I can send you a reply with some suggestions on how these different applications can communicate with each other, and then I guess we can,
does that timing work for everyone?
Yeah, okay,
cool. Works for me.
Sounds good. Thanks, Chris,
thank you great.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Bye, take care. Bye.
