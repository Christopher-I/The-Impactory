# Impact Briefing Analysis - Key Takeaways

## What This Document Reveals

### 1. YOUR INTEGRATION INSIGHT WAS RIGHT ✅

**The #1 finding in their own research:**
> "Impact areas that do not account for intersectionality allow the amazing work of our local associations to get lost."

**Evidence:**
- **r = .88** correlation between Racial Violence and Gender-Based Violence
- **r = .853** correlation between Racial Violence and Economic Violence
- **r = .782** correlation between Economic Violence and Beneficiary Impact

**Real Quote from an LA:**
> "It is Black maternal health week this week, And I did include that under, I believe, sexual, racial and economic violence [in the survey] because I believe we address all of those issues."

**Their Solution:**
Moving from abstract "impact areas" to **functional categories** (e.g., "Housing") then emphasizing which violence types it addresses (Racial, Gender-Based, Economic - or combination).

---

### 2. PROGRAM CATEGORIZATION APPROACH (ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION!)

They're moving from:
- ❌ Old: "Health & Safety," "Women's Empowerment," "Racial Justice"
- ✅ New: Functional categories that can address multiple violence types

**New Program Categories:**
1. **Housing** (30+ programs, 20+ LAs)
   - Emergency, temporary, transitional housing
   - DV shelters, homeless services, senior housing

2. **Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault** (35+ programs, 20+ LAs)
   - Shelters, case management, legal assistance, counseling

3. **Adult Education & Well-Being** (60+ programs, 35+ LAs)
   - Economic advancement, job training, financial literacy
   - Senior care, language services, addiction recovery

4. **Youth Education & Well-Being** (80+ programs, 40+ LAs)
   - Childcare, early learning, after school programs
   - Leadership development, harm prevention

5. **Community Education & Awareness** (10+ programs, 15+ LAs)
   - Outreach, events, community engagement

6. **Policy & Advocacy** (20+ programs, 15+ LAs)
   - Legislative advocacy, policy training, civic engagement

**Each program can address Racial, Gender-Based, and/or Economic violence simultaneously.**

### 3. THE THREE IMPACT LEVELS (CRITICAL FRAMEWORK!)

**Beneficiary Level** (Direct impact on people served):
- Increase access to basic needs
- Increase confidence/skills
- Increase sense of belonging/safety
- **>80% of current programs** operate here

**Institutional Level** (Impact on institutions perpetuating inequity):
- Compel institutions to engage on social issues
- Get institutions to recognize their role in harm
- Get institutions to take steps to undo harm
- **<40% of current programs** operate here

**Societal Level** (Impact on policy, narrative, lasting change):
- Shift public communication about issues
- Reduce/eliminate social denial
- Change public policy
- Position YWCA as leader in solutions
- **<10% of current programs** operate here

**The Gap:** LAs are excellent at beneficiary level but want to move up to institutional/societal levels. This requires **data capability and research support**.

---

### 4. CURRENT DATA CHALLENGES (THEIR PAIN POINTS)

**Quote from LA:**
> "So I guess, honestly, more support with our systems and data would be huge from YWCA USA…Our systems are terrible."

**Quote from LA:**
> "So for domestic violence and sexual assault, there is a state mandated program that you have to use for data entry...We do something else for our timekeeping...all of these things are like completely separate systems."

**What LAs Have:**
- Good at measuring **outputs** (how many people served, hotline calls, kids in programs)
- Multiple disconnected systems (DV tracking, timekeeping, case notes all separate)
- State-mandated systems for certain programs

**What LAs Struggle With:**
- Measuring **outcomes** (what actually changed for people)
- Tracking individual stories/progress without good systems
- Consistent data practices across LAs
- Translating data into policy advocacy

**What LAs Want:**
- "Data analytics" (though this means different things to different LAs)
- Tools to demonstrate impact beyond numbers
- Support and guidance on data collection/usage

---

### 5. THE "BEST KEPT SECRET" PROBLEM

**Key Finding:**
LAs are known for individual programs (e.g., "the childcare place") but not recognized as YWCA brand.

**Quote from LA:**
> "we're the best kept secret in [community], and we're tired of being the best kept secret. Not understanding that means more work, because then you gotta document and prove it."

**Why This Matters for the Platform:**
- Reports must help LAs demonstrate impact beyond beneficiary level
- Need to support policy advocacy and institutional engagement
- Must position LAs as data-backed leaders in their communities

---

### 6. SCALE & REACH

**Network Impact:**
- **1,445,489 beneficiaries** reached (unduplicated)
- **98%** women and girls
- **80%** children
- **>70%** people of color
- **>80%** low income (<$35K annually)
- **250+ unique programs** reported
- **167 LAs** responded to survey (out of 196)

---

### 7. ASPIRATIONS vs. REALITY

**What LAs Want to Achieve (But Aren't Yet):**
1. Be positioned as leaders in developing solutions to social problems (39%)
2. Reduce social denial about issues (35%)
3. Change or influence public policy (31%)
4. Shift public communication about issues (29%)

**Programs They Want to Implement:**
1. More public awareness campaigns (48%)
2. Build coalitions and partnerships (46%)
3. Reach more people (44%)
4. Train professionals (38%)
5. **Develop and distribute data and research to influence policy (29%)**

**The Gap:** They know they need data/research capability to achieve these goals, but they don't have it.

---

### 8. THE 3% WHO ARE SUCCEEDING AT POLICY LEVEL

**Key Finding:**
Among the small 3% of LAs with policy change as a stated goal, **100% say they're achieving it**.

**What They Do:**
- Government counterparts go through Justice Equity and Belonging training
- Meet with bipartisan legislators to understand their priorities
- Align advocacy work with what legislators are actually working on
- Focus on police reform, probation reform, affordable housing, tenant rights
- Use YWCA's mission/data to inform policy conversations

**Quote from High-Performing LA:**
> "every year, our head of RSJ and advocacy, goes out and actually talks to a whole bunch of [bipartisan] legislators and says, 'What are you focused on this year?' [She] talks about how that ties into our mission and then comes back and goes…Here's our policy pillars, but based on what the legislators are actually going to do, here's what we're going to focus on this year…"

**Lesson:** Data-backed advocacy works. But most LAs don't have the capability.

---

### 9. WHAT'S MISSING/ASPIRATIONAL

Based on Nina's email: "some of it we don't have immediate access to, or it doesn't exist yet"

**Likely Missing:**
- Trauma graph (might only be concept/demo)
- Published research papers using YWCA data (aspirational)
- Formalized data-to-research pipeline (doesn't exist yet)
- Consistent cross-LA data (everyone uses different systems)

**Likely Available:**
- Impact Survey responses (they have this)
- Program categorization examples (shown in briefing)
- LA quotes/stories from qualitative interviews (shown in briefing)
- Impact framework (detailed in briefing)

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR THURSDAY

### Your Integration Insight is Their #1 Problem
They literally identified "programs don't fit neatly into categories" as their top insight. The platform IS the solution to this.

### Data Structure Strategy is Clear Now
**Approach:**
- Programs belong to **functional categories** (Housing, DV/SA, Education, etc.)
- Programs address **one or more violence types** (Racial, Gender-Based, Economic)
- Programs target **one or more impact levels** (Beneficiary, Institutional, Societal)

**This is a tagging system, not a rigid hierarchy.**

### Edge Cases Are the Norm, Not the Exception
With r=.88 and r=.853 correlations, most programs span multiple violence types. The system MUST support this.

### The Real Value Prop
Not just "easier data entry" or "grant reports." The platform must enable LAs to:
1. Move from beneficiary-level to institutional/societal-level impact
2. Become data-backed policy advocates
3. Position themselves as community leaders (not "best kept secret")
4. Demonstrate outcomes, not just outputs

### Current Systems Are Fragmented
LAs use multiple disconnected systems mandated by different entities. The platform must either:
- Replace all of them (hard)
- Integrate with them (complex)
- Provide value so compelling they're willing to add another system (requires clear ROI)

---

## QUESTIONS NOW ANSWERED

✅ **How do they categorize programs?**
- Functional categories (Housing, DV/SA, Education, etc.) + violence types + impact levels

✅ **What about edge cases?**
- They're the norm. High correlation means programs inherently address multiple violence types.

✅ **How rigid is the framework?**
- They're moving away from rigid categories to flexible tagging.

✅ **What data challenges do LAs face?**
- Multiple disconnected systems, good at outputs but struggle with outcomes.

✅ **What do they mean by "data capability"?**
- Ability to demonstrate impact, support policy advocacy, track outcomes not just outputs.

## QUESTIONS STILL TO EXPLORE THURSDAY

### 1. Show Me the Trauma Graph
- Does it actually exist or is it still concept/demo?
- If it exists, what does it show?
- How do LAs currently access it?

### 2. Show Me Research Examples
- Do they have published research using YWCA data?
- Or is this aspirational?
- What would a published paper look like?

### 3. Walk Through Data Flow
- How does data currently get from LA → 10Seven → Research?
- Where does it break down?
- What's manual vs. automated?

### 4. Show Me Grant Examples
- What do chapters actually submit for funding?
- What data do they need?
- What's hard to compile?

### 5. MVP Prioritization
- Functional categories + violence type tagging must be v1
- Impact level tracking probably v1
- Policy advocacy support - v1 or v2?
- Trauma graph integration - v1 or v2?

### 6. Survey Data Import
- Do they want to import Impact Survey responses as baseline?
- Or start fresh with new data model?

## UPDATED APPROACH FOR THURSDAY

**Start with:**
"This Impact Briefing is incredibly valuable - it answers several of my questions, especially around program categorization and the challenges LAs face. I now understand the intersectionality problem and why programs don't fit neatly into categories. Let's start by exploring what exists vs. what's aspirational..."

**Prioritize:**
1. What actually exists today (trauma graph, research examples, data pipelines)
2. How data currently flows (or doesn't) from LAs to 10Seven
3. What the platform must do to support institutional/societal level impact (not just beneficiary)
4. MVP definition based on what creates most value for policy advocacy

**De-prioritize:**
- Abstract discussions about framework (they've figured this out)
- Hypothetical workflows (focus on current reality)
- Technical implementation (comes after understanding current state)
