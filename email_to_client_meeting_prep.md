# Email to Client - Thursday Meeting Prep

**Subject:** Thursday Meeting Prep - Questions & Materials

---

Hi Nina, Andrea, and Chloe,

Looking forward to our meeting on Thursday! I've reviewed the call transcript, the 61-page YWCA survey, and your impact framework document, and I have a much clearer picture of what you're building.

To make the most of our time together, I wanted to share the key areas I'd love to explore with you. My goal is to **see how you work today** so I can understand where the platform can help most.

## What to Expect Thursday

**Meeting Structure (2 hours):**
- Part 1: Show me how you work today (current tools, processes, pain points)
- Part 2: Walk through integration scenarios (how YWCA data, 10Seven research, and Trauma Graph connect)
- Part 3: Clarify scope and priorities (MVP, timeline, success metrics)

I'll be asking a lot of "show me" questions rather than abstract "how would you" questions. Real examples help me understand so much better than hypothetical scenarios!

## Key Questions for Thursday

These are the most important ones to cover during our call:

### 1. Show Me Your Research Process
**"Can you show me a research paper you've published or are working on that uses YWCA network data?"**

If you have one handy, we can walk through it together. If not, no problem - we can talk through one you're planning to publish. I want to understand:
- What data you need from YWCA chapters
- How you currently get that data
- What's challenging about the current process
- How you aggregate and analyze across 196 chapters

### 2. Show Me the Trauma Graph
**"Can you show me the trauma graph during the call?"**

I'd love to see it in action so I understand:
- What geographic levels it covers
- What trauma indicators are shown
- How a chapter would actually use it
- How it connects to YWCA program data

### 3. Show Me How You Categorize Programs
**"Can you walk me through how you categorize a program into your framework (Racial Violence, Gender-Based Violence, Economic Violence)?"**

Especially interested in:
- A real example that was challenging to categorize
- How you handle programs that address multiple violence types
- Programs that don't fit neatly into the framework

### 4. Walk Through Integration Scenarios
**"Let's trace how data flows from a YWCA chapter → through the platform → into your research → into publications"**

I want to understand every step, especially where things break down or get manual today.

### 5. Show Me Grant Examples
**"Can you show me a grant application a chapter has submitted or is working on?"**

This helps me understand what "grant-ready reports" actually means and what data chapters need most urgently.

### 6. Clarify MVP & Timeline
**"What MUST be in version 1 for this to be useful to YWCA chapters?"**

And realistically, when do you need this?

## Materials That Would Help (If You Can Share Before/During Meeting)

No rush on these - whatever you have handy is great:

- ✅ October 2024 survey responses from a few chapters (anonymized is fine)
- ✅ Example research paper using YWCA data (published or draft)
- ✅ Sample grant application from a chapter
- ✅ Access to the trauma graph (even if it's just a demo)
- ✅ Any previous technical proposals or wireframes (if they exist)

If you don't have some of these yet, totally fine - we can work through scenarios instead.

## Additional Questions (For Follow-Up Doc or Later)

These are important but don't need to be covered in the 2-hour meeting. We can address them via email/doc after our call:

- Survey replacement strategy details (import October data vs. start fresh)
- Cross-chapter data visibility rules (what can Buffalo see about Rochester's programs?)
- Update frequency by data type (how often chapters update different info)
- User account structure and permissions
- Integration details with existing tools (Qualtrics, Max QDA, Tableau)
- Data governance and ownership specifics

I'll send a follow-up doc after Thursday to capture these.

## My Approach

I want to understand **your world** - how you work today, where it breaks, what you wish you could do but can't. That's how I'll design the right solution.

So expect lots of:
- "Can you show me...?"
- "Walk me through..."
- "How do you currently...?"

And not so much:
- "How should the system...?"
- "What features do you want...?"

(That comes after I understand the problem deeply!)

## Questions for Me?

Any questions or anything you'd like me to prepare differently? Just let me know.

Looking forward to Thursday!

Best,
Chris

**P.S.** If it's helpful, I can record the meeting (with everyone's permission) so I can review details later and you don't have to worry about repeating anything. Just let me know if that works for you.
